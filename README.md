üîç **About Me**

I am Dr. Christos Ntanos, a Research Director and Senior Researcher with extensive education in Electronic and Computer Engineering, having earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of Birmingham, UK. I also hold a Master's in Business Administration (MBA) from Athens University of Economics and Business, and a PhD from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

My professional expertise lies in managing ICT and cross-disciplinary research and implementation projects, with notable experience under the Horizon programmes. I currently coordinate the MES-CoBraD project, aimed at developing a multidisciplinary expert system for managing Complex Brain Disorders. I have also led the "Search and Rescue" project, which focuses on emerging technologies for locating entrapped victims and enhancing first responder safety. Additionally, I was the project coordinator for "SPHINX - A Universal Cyber Security Toolkit for Health-Care Industry," designed to mitigate cyber risks in healthcare facilities to safeguard privacy and infrastructure.

My role in the ChildRescue project involved collaboration with NGOs from Greece and Belgium to improve the processes for locating and tracking missing children and children in migration. With decades of experience I bring a comprehensive perspective to research and implementation projects, encompassing managerial, design, implementation, societal, ethics, and legal aspects. My skills extend to ICT solutions management, estimating IT and database systems, context awareness, risk management, Decision Support Systems, Business Process Reengineering, Knowledge Representation, eGovernment, and eParticipation.
